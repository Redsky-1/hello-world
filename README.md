# hello-world
One day I'll know what I'm doing!

I'm trying to retrain myself as a software/web developer. I've started by watching tutorials on C# and following an online JavaScript course. I'll be posting my progress on twitter using the #100daysofcode and I'm not going to stop until I get there.
